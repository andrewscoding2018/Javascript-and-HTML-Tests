                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo. After graduating from design school
                    with a specialization in diamond cutting and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown,
                    Austin and started to grow her business online. Mariana has always managed every aspect of the
                    business, from jewelry design to marketing to e-commerce. However, she recently hired several
                    artisans to help craft her designs and a young employee to help manage the company website and
                    social media accounts.
